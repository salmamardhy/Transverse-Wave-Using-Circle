# Transverse-Wave-Using-Circle
The final project in the Computer Programming course using Pygame. 

The waves that will be used in the simulation are transverse waves which are formed from the circular motion of a circle experiencing acceleration. The simulation display has been enhanced to be more appealing through the addition of images and sound.
